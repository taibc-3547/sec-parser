Change and a Make-Whole Fundamental Change (each as defined in the indenture (the &#8220;Indenture&#8221;) governing Holdings&#8217; 7.00%
Exchangeable Notes due 2026 (the &#8220;Notes&#8221;)), which will be effective within five business days of the Closing. <span style="color: #212529; background-color: white">As
a result of the Make-Whole Fundamental Change, each holder of Notes will have the right to exchange its Notes at an exchange rate that
the Company expects will be increased temporarily. This increased exchange rate will apply only to exchanges of Notes beginning on the
effective date of the Make-Whole Fundamental Change and ending on the business day immediately preceding the Fundamental Change Repurchase
Date (as defined below). Following this period, the Exchange Rate will revert to its current Exchange Rate. Once the Make-Whole Fundamental
Change has become effective, the Company will issue a notice to holders of the Notes pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, and which
the Company intends to disclose via an amendment to this Current Report on Form 8-K.</span></p>

Date, in accordance with and subject to the satisfaction <span style="color: #212529; background-color: white">by the holder of the requirements
set forth in the Indenture. The repurchase price will be 100% of the principal amount of such Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest
thereon, to, but excluding, the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date. On or before the 20<sup>th</sup> calendar day after the effective
date of the Fundamental Change, Holdings will deliver to holders a notice constituting a Fundamental Change Company Notice (as defined
in the Indenture) specifying the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date, which will be a date not less than 20 business days or more than
35 business days following the date of the Fundamental Change Company Notice.</span></p>
