Upon the consummation of the Spin Off, Millrose became an independent public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the &#8220;NYSE&#8221;) under the symbol &#8220;MRP&#8221;. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Millrose is externally managed by Kennedy Lewis Land and Residential Advisors LLC (the &#8220;Manager&#8221;), an affiliate and subsidiary of Kennedy Lewis Investment Management LLC (&#8220;Kennedy Lewis&#8221;). The Manager provides Millrose access to the Manager&#8217;s deep financial expertise, extensive operational platforms and strong homebuilder relationships. Immediately following the Spin-Off, the Manager will leverage its full resources to deliver its already robust backlog of deals and to pursue accretive homesite option purchase arrangements with other third-party homebuilders and developers throughout the industry. The Manager is currently actively evaluating these potential transactions for suitability for Millrose using its standard due diligence procedures and expects to have one or more of such transactions under contract by the time Millrose announces its financial results for the first quarter of 2025. Millrose expects to utilize its revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement (as defined below) to finance these transactions. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the Spin Off, Lennar has contributed $5.5 billion in land assets and cash of $1 billion to Millrose. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the <span style="white-space:nowrap">Spin-Off,</span> Millrose entered into several agreements, as described below. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Management Agreement </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On the Distribution Date, Millrose and the Manager entered into the Management Agreement (the &#8220;Management Agreement&#8221;).

In addition, the Manager is required to provide Millrose with sufficiently experienced and qualified personnel to perform all services, including officers of Millrose and its subsidiaries. Further, the Management Agreement includes a policy governing the allocation of investment opportunities not involving Lennar between Millrose and certain affiliates of Kennedy Lewis. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to the Management Agreement, Millrose will pay the Manager a management fee in an amount equal to 1.25% per annum of Tangible Assets (as defined in the Management Agreement) or 0.3125% per quarter (the &#8220;Management Fee&#8221;) to be calculated as set forth in the Management Agreement.
