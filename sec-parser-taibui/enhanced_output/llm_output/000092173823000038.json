December 2, 2024, Microchip Technology Incorporated (the “Company”) announced the closure of manufacturing operations at its Tempe, Arizona wafer fabrication facility (referred to as “Fab 2”). Fab 2 produces 8-inch wafers and supports various manufacturing process technologies and predominantly utilizes the Company’s 0.25 microns to 1.0 microns processes. Many of the process technologies that run in Fab 2 also run in the Company’s Oregon and Colorado factories, which both have ample clean room space for expansion. The Company plans to transition manufacturing of products as needed from Fab 2 to such other facilities. This action is being taken since inventory levels are high and the Company has ample capacity in place and the ability to expand capacity in the other facilities in the future. The Company expects to be able to shut down the manufacturing operations of Fab 2 in the September 2025 quarter at which time the Company expects that it will generate annual cash savings of approximately $90 million. Due to the high inventory of the products which are manufactured in Fab 2, the Company does not expect to see savings from the shutdown until the start of the June 2026 quarter based on a first in-first-out basis. The Company expects that the Fab 2 closure will begin to help it moderate inventory levels beginning in the March 2025 quarter. This action is expected to affect approximately 500 employees. The Company anticipates near-term restructuring costs to be between $3 million and $8 million, and it is possible that the Company could incur other restructuring and shut-down costs in the future of up to an additional $15 million. The estimates of the restructuring costs will be refined over time as more information becomes available. The Company may incur additional expenses in connection with these actions that are not currently contemplated. The charges that the Company expects to incur in connection with these actions are estimates and subject to a number of assumptions, and actual results may differ materially. The Company has not yet determined if any accelerated depreciation or impairment charges will be recorded.","l":4},{"t":"CONTAINER","c":"span","l":4,"ch":[{"t":"SECTION_TITLE","c":"On December 2, 2024, Microchip Technology Incorporated (the “Company”) announced the closure of manufacturing operations at its Tempe, Arizona wafer fabrication facility (referred to as “Fab 2”).
