Forward-looking statements are not historical facts or statements of current conditions, but instead represent only the Company’s beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of the Company’s control. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements related to the Reverse Stock Split, the trading of the Company’s Class A Common Stock on the NYSE and the Company’s ongoing business operations. In some cases, you can identify these forward-looking statements by the use of words such as “outlook,” “believes,” “expects,” “potential,” “continues,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “seeks,” “projects,” “predicts,” “intends,” “plans,” “estimates,” “budgets,” “forecasts,” “anticipates,” or the negative version of these words or other comparable words.
